## Welcome to PixelStudio

From a designer’s perspective, it’s all about downloads. Some fonts are tightly held intellectual property with very intentionally limited sharing. So, at a minimum, a Typography page must provide direct download or instructions on how to get approval to obtain them. Most teams provide a downloadable ZIP that includes all the files you need to install and use fonts locally. Headings are a critical contributor to page hierarchy. Most systems offer at least four, although some offer many more. Page titles usually (but not always) align with the largest heading level.

Additionally, some systems offer specialized headers outside the typical heading scale, such as a picture’s caption or an eyebrow Morningstar Design System. Just because a header exists outside the traditional scale doesn’t mean it’s not a header viably reused ee agic grape across a catalog.

### What I do?
A misconception I debunk early and often: developing a typography system for UI components is equivalent to solving.

### Who I do it?
Article typography is made of headings, body text, and a few other components like an captioned image.

# About me
Applying heading scales shouldn’t require use of a specific HTML element. Instead, tease apart the two concerns. A system should weave heading levels consistently throughout components and offers tools for adopters to do the same with their custom creations. In particular, line-height is challenging. In some libraries, we’ll use conventions and tools to crop away negative space established by line-height from all text included in components, as described in Space in Design Systems. Libraries cropping line height include Morningstar Design System, Discovery Education’s Comet Design System.

## Heading Levels and Special Cases
Systems can offer centrally-tuned responsive type sizes across a predictable set of breakpoints. For body text, size increases slowly.

As a system gets started with type, dig into details and start some conventions, such as how you’ll cope with line-height. However, avoid finalizing all rules before making the first thing. Instead, be comfortable with chaos early and smooth details as a library takes shape. As you near a major release, lock in conventions and ensure tools are consistently applied.

## Text color
- ***Primary***, for most interface text whether body or heading.
- ***Secondary***, for diminished contrast (often, the “gray text”) for supplemental information.
- ***Interactive***, not just for links but also flat buttons, tab labels, and more.
- ***Disabled***, often resulting is especially lower contrast treatments.
- ***An invitation*** to contact a technical architect, since a license for the font is required. Organizations requires this to control the recurring and often non-trivial cost of hosting and serving the font.
